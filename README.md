## Technologies Used

**Mi Casa** is built with the following technologies:

- **Kaboom.js**: A simple and powerful 2D game framework for JavaScript/Typescript that enables us to create fast-paced, interactive gameplay. Kaboom.js is used for rendering the game world, managing player interactions, and controlling the game's logic and animations.
  
- **React**: React is used to handle the user interface (UI) for game elements like the dialogue box, which appears when interacting with characters. React ensures smooth, component-based updates and a dynamic experience throughout the game.

- **Canvas API**: The game‚Äôs environment and character animations are rendered using the HTML5 Canvas API, which gives us the flexibility to design and control everything down to the pixel level.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used to ensure strong typing and better development experience with IDE support, error checking, and cleaner code for the game‚Äôs mechanics.

- **Custom Animations & Sprite Sheets**: The game‚Äôs characters and actions are animated using sprite sheets, allowing for smooth, frame-based animation for walking and idle states.

- **Game Logic**: Custom game logic is written using JavaScript to handle interactions, player movement, collision detection, and dialogue management.
